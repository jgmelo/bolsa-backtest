While the noise and coupling effects are negligible at older\\ngeneration technologies, these play an important role in nanometer tech-\\nnologies. Thus, the physical design should consider the effect of crosstalk', 'and noise and the design verification should then include the effects of\\ncrosstalk and noise.\\n1.2 What is Static Timing Analysis?\\nStatic Timing Analysis (also referred as STA) is one of the many tech-\\nniques available to verify the timing of a digital design. An alternate ap-\\nproach used to verify the timing is the timing simulation which can verify', 'the functionality as well as the timing of the design. The term timing analy-\\nsis is used to refer to either of these two methods - static timing analysis, or\\nthe timing simulation. Thus, timing analysis simply refers to the analysis of\\nthe design for timing issues.\\nThe STA is static since the analysis of the design is carried out statically and', 'does not depend upon the data values being applied at the input pins. This\\nis in contrast to simulation based timing analysis where a stimulus is ap-\\nplied on input signals, resulting behavior is observed and verified, then\\ntime is advanced with new input stimulus applied, and the new behavior\\nis observed and verified and so on.', 'is observed and verified and so on.\\nGiven a design along with a set of input clock definitions and the definition\\nof the external environment of the design, the purpose of static timing\\nanalysis is to validate if the design can operate at the rated speed. That is,\\nthe design can operate safely at the specified frequency of the clocks with-', 'out any timing violations. Figure 1-1 shows the basic functionality of static\\n1. Deep submicron refers to process technologies with a feature size of 0.25 mm or lower.\\nThe process technologies with feature size below 0.1 mm are referred to as nanometer tech-\\nnologies. Examples of such process technologies are 90nm, 65nm, 45nm, and 32nm. The', 'finer process technologies normally allow a greater number of metal layers for intercon-\\nnect.', 'What is Static Timing Analysis? S ECTION 1.2\\n3\\ntiming analysis. The DUA is the design under analysis. Some examples of\\ntiming checks are setup and hold checks. A setup check ensures that the\\ndata can arrive at a flip-flop within the given clock period. A hold check\\nensures that the data is held for at least a minimum time so that there is no', 'unexpected pass-through of data through a flip-flop: that is, it ensures that\\na flip-flop captures the intended data correctly. These checks ensure that\\nthe proper data is ready and available for capture and latched in for the\\nnew state.\\nThe more important aspect of static timing analysis is that the entire design\\nis analyzed once and the required timing checks are performed for all pos-', 'sible paths and scenarios of the design. Thus, STA is a complete and ex-\\nhaustive method for verifying the timing of a design.\\nFigure 1-1 Static timing analysis.\\nDesign\\nunder\\nanalysis\\n(DUA)\\nStatic Timing Analysis\\n(STA)\\nExternal environment\\nof design\\n(including clock definitions)\\nTiming reports\\n(include violating\\npaths, if any)', 'CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\n4\\nThe design under analysis is typically specified using a hardware descrip-\\ntion language such as VHDL1 or Verilog HDL2. The external environment,\\nincluding the clock definitions, are specified typically using SDC 3 or an\\nequivalent format. SDC is a timing constraint specification language. The\\ntiming reports are in ASCII form, typically with multiple columns, with', 'each column showing one attribute of the path delay. Many examples of\\ntiming reports are provided as illustrations in this book.\\n1.3 Why Static Timing Analysis?\\nStatic timing analysis is a complete and exhaustive verification of all timing\\nchecks of a design. Other timing analysis methods such as simulation can\\nonly verify the portions of the design that get exercised by stimulus. Verifi-', 'cation through timing simulation is only as exhaustive as the test vectors\\nused. To simulate and verify all timing conditions of a design with 10-100\\nmillion gates is very slow and the timing cannot be verified completely.\\nThus, it is very difficult to do exhaustive verification through simulation.\\nStatic timing analysis on the other hand provides a faster and simpler way', 'of checking and analyzing all the timing paths in a design for any timing\\nviolations. Given the complexity of present day ASICs 4, which may con-\\ntain 10 to 100 million gates, the static timing analysis has become a necessi-\\nty to exhaustively verify the timing of a design.\\nCrosstalk and Noise\\nThe design functionality and its performance can be limited by noise. The', 'noise occurs due to crosstalk with other signals or due to noise on primary\\ninputs or the power supply. The noise impact can limit the frequency of\\n1. See [BHA99] in Bibliography.\\n2.

Thus, a de-\\nsign implementation must be verified to be robust which means that it can\\nwithstand the noise without affecting the rated performance of the design.\\nVerification based upon logic simulation cannot handle the effects of cross-\\ntalk, noise and on-chip variations.', 'talk, noise and on-chip variations.\\nThe analysis methods described in this book cover not only the traditional\\ntiming analysis techniques but also noise analysis to verify the design in-\\ncluding the effects of noise.\\n1.4 Design Flow\\nThis section primarily describes the CMOS1 digital design flow in the con-\\ntext used in the rest of this book. A brief description of its applicability to', 'FPGAs2 and to asynchronous designs is also provided.\\n1.4.1 CMOS Digital Designs\\nIn a CMOS digital design flow, the static timing analysis can be performed\\nat many different stages of the implementation. Figure 1-2 shows a typical\\nflow.\\nSTA is rarely done at the RTL level as, at this point, it is more important to\\nverify the functionality of the design as opposed to timing. Also not all tim-', 'ing information is available since the descriptions of the blocks are at the\\ngate level, the STA is used to verify the timing of the design. STA can also\\nbe run prior to performing logic optimization - the goal is to identify the\\nworst or critical timing paths. STA can be rerun after logic optimization to\\n1.

Once the physical design starts and after clock\\ntrees are built, STA can be performed to check the timing again.

The parasitic RC ( Resistance and Capacitance) of the metal\\ntraces impact the signal path delay through these traces. In a typical nano-', 'meter design, the parasitics of the interconnect can account for the majority\\nof the delay and power dissipation in the design. Thus, any analysis of the\\ndesign should evaluate the impact of the interconnect on the performance\\ncharacteristics (speed, power, etc.). As mentioned previously, coupling be-\\ntween signal traces contributes to noise, and the design verification must', 'include the impact of the noise on the performance.\\nAt the logical design phase, ideal interconnect may be assumed since there\\nis no physical information related to the placement; there may be more in-\\nterest in viewing the logic that contributes to the worst paths. Another\\ntechnique used at this stage is to estimate the length of the interconnect us-', 'ing a wireload model. The wireload model provides estimated RC based\\non the fanouts of a cell.\\nBefore the routing of traces are finalized, the implementation tools use an\\nestimate of the routing distance to obtain RC parasitics for the route. Since\\nthe routing is not finalized, this phase is called the global route phase to dis-', 'tinguish it from the final route phase. In the global route phase of the physi-\\ncal design, simplified routes are used to estimate routing lengths, and the\\nrouting estimates are used to determine resistance and capacitance that are\\nneeded to compute wire delays. During this phase, one can not include the\\neffect of coupling. After the detailed routing is complete, actual RC values', 'obtained from extraction are used and the effect of coupling can be ana-\\nlyzed. However, a physical design tool may still use approximations to\\nhelp improve run times in computing RC values.\\nAn extraction tool is used to extract the detailed parasitics (RC values)\\nfrom a routed design. Such an extractor may have an option to obtain para-', 'sitics with small runtime and less accurate RC values during iterative opti-\\nmization and another option for final verification during which very\\naccurate RC values are extracted with a larger runtime.', 'CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\n8\\nTo summarize, the static timing analysis can be performed on a gate-level\\nnetlist depending on:\\ni. How interconnect is modeled - ideal interconnect, wireload\\nmodel, global routes with approximate RCs, or real routes with\\naccurate RCs.\\nii. How clocks are modeled - whether clocks are ideal (zero delay)\\nor propagated (real delays).', 'or propagated (real delays).\\niii. Whether the coupling between signals is included - whether\\nany crosstalk noise is analyzed.\\nFigure 1-2 may seem to imply that STA is done outside of the implementa-\\ntion steps, that is, STA is done after each of the synthesis, logic optimiza-\\ntion, and physical design steps. In reality, each of these steps perform', 'integrated (and incremental) STA within their functionality. For example,\\nthe timing analysis engine within the logic optimization step is used to\\nidentify critical paths that the optimizer needs to work on. Similarly, the in-\\ntegrated timing analysis engine in a placement tool is used to maintain the\\ntiming of the design as layout progresses incrementally.\\n1.4.2 FPGA Designs', '1.4.2 FPGA Designs\\nThe basic flow of STA is still valid in an FPGA. Even though routing in an\\nFPGA is constrained to channels, the mechanism to extract parasitics and\\nperform STA is identical to a CMOS digital design flow. For example, STA\\ncan be performed assuming interconnects as ideal, or using a wireload\\nmodel, assuming clock trees as ideal or real, assuming global routes, or us-', 'ing real routes for parasitics.\\n1.4.3 Asynchronous Designs\\nThe principles of STA are applicable in asynchronous designs also. One\\nmay be more interested in timing from one signal in the design to another\\nas opposed to doing setup and hold checks which may be non-existent.\\nThus, most of the checks may be point to point timing checks, or skew', 'STA at Different Design Phases S ECTION 1.5\\n9\\nchecks.

In a CMOS logic gate, the output node is connected by a pull-up\\nstructure (made up of PMOS transistors) to Vdd and a pull-down structure\\n(made up of NMOS transistors) to Vss. As an example, a two-input CMOS', 'nand gate is shown in Figure 2-3. In this example, the pull-up structure is\\ncomprised of the two parallel PMOS transistors and the pull-down struc-\\nture is made up of two series NMOS transistors.\\nFor any CMOS logic gate, the pull-up and pull-down structures are com-\\nplementary. For inputs at logic-0 or logic-1, this means that if the pull-up', 'stage is turned on, the pull-down stage will be off and similarly if the pull-\\nup stage is turned off, the pull-down stage will be turned on. The pull-\\ndown and pull-up structures are governed by the logic function imple-\\nmented by the CMOS gate. For example, in a CMOSnand gate, the function\\ncontrolling the pull-down structure is “A and B”, that is, the pull-down is', 'turned on when A and B are both at logic-1. Similarly, the function control-\\nling the pull-up structure is “not A or not B”, that is, the pull-up is turnedon\\nwhen either A or B is at logic-0.

Another important', 'aspect of CMOS logic is that the inputs pose only a capacitive load to the\\nprevious stage.\\nThe CMOS logic gate is an inverting gate which means that a single switch-\\ning input (rising or falling) can only cause the output to switch in the oppo-\\nsite direction, that is, the output can not switch in the same direction as the\\nswitching input.

In real-\\nity, the load seen by the cell output is comprised of capacitance as well as\\ninterconnect resistance. The interconnect resistance becomes an issue since\\nthe NLDM approach assumes that the output loading is purely capacitive.\\nEven with non-zero interconnect resistance, these NLDM models have', 'been utilized when the effect of interconnect resistance is small. In pres-\\nence of resistive interconnect, the delay calculation methodologies retrofit\\nthe NLDM models by obtaining an equivalent effective capacitance at the\\noutput of the cell. The “effective” capacitance methodology used within\\ndelay calculation tools obtains an equivalent capacitance that has the same', 'delay at the output of the cell as the cell with RC interconnect. The effective\\ncapacitance approach is described as part of delay calculation in Section\\n5.2.\\nAs the feature size shrinks, the effect of interconnect resistance can result in\\nlarge inaccuracy as the waveforms become highly non-linear. Various\\nmodeling approaches provide additional accuracy for the cell output driv-', 'ers. Broadly, these approaches obtain higher accuracy by modeling the out-', 'CHAPTER 3 Standard Cell Library\\n76\\nput stage of the driver by an equivalent current source. Examples of these\\napproaches are - CCS (Composite Current Source), or ECSM ( Effective\\nCurrent Source Model). For example, the CCS timing models provide the\\nadditional accuracy for modeling cell output drivers by using a time-vary-\\ning and voltage-dependent current source.

Unlike the pin capacitance for the NLDM', 'models, the CCS models allow separate specification of receiver capaci-\\ntance in different portions of the transitioning waveform. Due to intercon-\\nnect RC and the equivalent input non-linear capacitance due to the Miller\\neffect from the input devices within the cell, the receiver capacitance value\\nvaries at different points on the transitioning waveform. This capacitance', 'is thus modeled differently in the initial (or leading) portion of waveform\\nversus the trailing portion of the waveform.\\nThe receiver pin capacitance can be specified at the pin level (like in NLDM\\nmodels) where all timing arcs through that pin use that capacitance value.\\nAlternately, the receiver capacitance can be specified at the timing arc level', 'in which case different capacitance models can be specified for different\\ntiming arcs.

By\\nusing high Vt cells 1, one can reduce the subthreshold current; however,\\n1. The high Vt cells refer to cells with higher threshold voltage than the standard for the\\nprocess technology.', 'Power Dissipation Modeling S ECTION 3.8\\n93\\nthere is a trade-off due to reduced speed of the high Vt cells. The high Vt\\ncells have smaller leakage but are slower in speed. Similarly, the low Vt\\ncells have larger leakage but allow greater speed. The contribution due to\\ngate oxide tunneling does not change significantly by switching to high (or', 'low) Vt cells. Thus, a possible way to control the leakage power is to utilize\\nhigh Vt cells. Similar to the selection between high Vt and standard Vt\\ncells, the strength of cells used in the design is a trade-off between leakage\\nand speed.

In most process technologies, the subthreshold\\nleakage can grow by 10x to 20x as the device junction temperature is in-\\ncreased from 25C to 125C. The contribution due to gate oxide tunneling is\\nrelatively invariant with respect to temperature or the Vt of the devices.', 'The gate oxide tunneling which was negligible at process technologies\\n100nm and above, has become a significant contributor to leakage at lower\\ntemperatures for 65nm or finer technologies.

At high temperatures, the sub-', 'threshold leakage continues to be the dominant contributor to leakage\\npower.\\nLeakage power is specified for each cell in the library. For example, an in-\\nverter cell may contain the following specification:\\ncell_leakage_power : 1.366;\\nThis is the leakage power dissipated in the cell - the leakage power units\\nare as specified in the header of the library, typically in nanowatts.

As described in Sec-\\ntion 6.2, the timing windows represent the earliest and the latest switching\\ntimes during which a net may switch within a clock cycle. If the timing\\nwindows of the aggressor and the victim overlap, the crosstalk effect on\\ndelay is computed. For multiple aggressors, the timing windows for multi-', 'ple aggressors are also analyzed similarly.

Such paths can be turned off dur-\\ning STA by setting these as false paths. A false path is ignored by the STA\\nfor analysis.\\nExamples of false paths could be from one clock domain to another clock', 'domain, from a clock pin of a flip-flop to the input of another flip-flop,\\nthrough a pin of a cell, through pins of multiple cells, or a combination of\\nthese. When a false path is specified through a pin of a cell, all paths that go\\nthrough that pin are ignored for timing analysis. The advantage of identi-\\nfying the false paths is that the analysis space is reduced, thereby allowing', 'the analysis to focus only on the real paths. This helps cut down the analy-\\nsis time as well. However, too many false paths which are wildcarded us-\\ning the through specification can slow down the analysis.\\nA false path is set using the set_false_path specification.

To set a false\\npath between two clock domains, use:\\nset_false_path -from [get_clocks clockA] \\\\\\n-to [get_clocks clockB]\\ninstead of:\\nset_false_path -from [get_pins {regA_*}/CP] \\\\\\n-to [get_pins {regB_*}/D]\\nThe second form is much slower.', 'The second form is much slower.\\nAnother recommendation is to minimize the usage of-through options, as it\\nadds unnecessary runtime complexity. The - through option should only be\\nused where it is absolutely necessary and there is no alternate way to spec-\\nify the false path.\\nFrom an optimization perspective, another guideline is to not use a false', 'path when a multicycle path is the real intent. If a signal is sampled at a\\nknown or predictable time, no matter how far out, a multicycle path speci-\\nfication should be used so that the path has some constraint and gets opti-\\nmized to meet the multicycle constraint.

The address and control are thus unidirec-', 'tional and go from the DUA to the SRAM as shown in Figure 9-7. A DLL\\n(delay-locked loop1) is typically placed in the clock path. The DLL allows\\nthe clock to be delayed, if necessary, to account for delay variations of the\\nvarious signals across the interface due to PVT tolerances and other exter-\\nnal variations.

In this section, we discuss the analysis of the process variations possi-\\nble on one die (called local process variations) which are much smaller than\\nthe variations across multiple manufacturing lots (called global process\\nvariations).\\nBesides the variations in the process parameters, different portions of the', 'design may also see different power supply voltage and temperature. It is\\ntherefore possible that two regions of the same chip are not at identical\\nPVT conditions. These differences can arise due to many factors, including:\\ni. IR drop variation along the die area affecting the local power\\nsupply.\\nii. Voltage threshold variation of the PMOS or the NMOS device.', 'iii. Channel length variation of the PMOS or the NMOS device.\\niv. Temperature variations due to local hot spots.\\nv. Interconnect metal etch or thickness variations impacting the in-\\nterconnect resistance or capacitance.\\nThe PVT variations described above are referred to as On-Chip Variations\\n(OCV) and these variations can affect the wire delays and cell delays in dif-', 'ferent portions of the chip. As discussed above, modeling of OCV is not in-\\ntended to model the entire span of the PVT variations possible from wafer\\nto wafer but to model the PVT variations that are possible locally within a\\nsingle die. The OCV effect is typically more pronounced on clock paths as\\nthey travel longer distances in a chip. One way to account for the local PVT', 'variations is to incorporate the OCV analysis during STA. The static timing\\nanalysis described in previous chapters obtains the timing at a specific tim-\\ning corner and does not model the variations along the die. Since the clock\\nand data paths can be affected differently by the OCV, the timing verifica-\\ntion can model the OCV effect by making the PVT conditions for the', 'launch and capture paths to be slightly different. The STA can include the\\nOCV effect by derating the delays of specific paths, that is, by making those\\npaths faster or slower and then validating the behavior of the design with\\nthese variations. The cell delays or wire delays or both can be derated to\\nmodel the effect of OCV.', 'On-Chip Variations S ECTION 10.1\\n367\\nWe now examine how the OCV derating is done for a setup check.

However, there are scenarios where the\\nleakage is a dominant component of the total power; in such cases, a de-', 'sign with high Vt cells can result in reduction of the total power. The above\\ntrade-off between cells with different Vt in terms of their speed and leak-\\nage needs to be utilized suitably since it is dependent on the design and its\\nswitching activity profile. Two scenarios of a high performance block are\\nillustrated below where the implementation approach can be different de-', 'pending on whether the block is very active or has low switching activity.\\nHigh Performance Block with High Activity\\nThis scenario is of a high performance block with high switching activity\\nand the power is dominated by the active power.

In such cases, the\\ninitial design implementation should use standard Vt (or low Vt) cells to\\nmeet the desired performance. After the required timing is achieved, the\\ncells along the paths which have positive timing slack can be changed into\\nhigh Vt cells so that the leakage contribution is reduced while still meeting', 'the timing requirement.

This means that the P-well for the NMOS devic-\\nes is connected to a small negative voltage (such as -0.5V). Similarly, the N-', 'well connection for the PMOS devices is connected to a voltage above the\\npower rail (such as Vdd + 0.5V). By adding a well bias, the speed of the cell\\nis impacted; however the leakage is reduced substantially. The timing in\\nthe cell libraries are generated by taking the well bias into account.\\nThe drawback of using well bias is that it requires additional supply levels', '(such as -0.5V and Vdd+0.5V) for the P-well and N-well connections.', 'CHAPTER 10 Robust Verification\\n418\\n10.7 Backannotation\\n10.7.1 SPEF\\nHow does STA know what the parasitics of the design are?

Thus, the physical design should consider the effect of crosstalk', 'and noise and the design verification should then include the effects of\\ncrosstalk and noise.\\n1.2 What is Static Timing Analysis?\\nStatic Timing Analysis (also referred as STA) is one of the many tech-\\nniques available to verify the timing of a digital design. An alternate ap-\\nproach used to verify the timing is the timing simulation which can verify', 'the functionality as well as the timing of the design. The term timing analy-\\nsis is used to refer to either of these two methods - static timing analysis, or\\nthe timing simulation. Thus, timing analysis simply refers to the analysis of\\nthe design for timing issues.\\nThe STA is static since the analysis of the design is carried out statically and', 'does not depend upon the data values being applied at the input pins. This\\nis in contrast to simulation based timing analysis where a stimulus is ap-\\nplied on input signals, resulting behavior is observed and verified, then\\ntime is advanced with new input stimulus applied, and the new behavior\\nis observed and verified and so on.', 'is observed and verified and so on.\\nGiven a design along with a set of input clock definitions and the definition\\nof the external environment of the design, the purpose of static timing\\nanalysis is to validate if the design can operate at the rated speed. That is,\\nthe design can operate safely at the specified frequency of the clocks with-', 'out any timing violations. Figure 1-1 shows the basic functionality of static\\n1. Deep submicron refers to process technologies with a feature size of 0.25 mm or lower.\\nThe process technologies with feature size below 0.1 mm are referred to as nanometer tech-\\nnologies. Examples of such process technologies are 90nm, 65nm, 45nm, and 32nm. The', 'finer process technologies normally allow a greater number of metal layers for intercon-\\nnect.', 'What is Static Timing Analysis? S ECTION 1.2\\n3\\ntiming analysis. The DUA is the design under analysis. Some examples of\\ntiming checks are setup and hold checks. A setup check ensures that the\\ndata can arrive at a flip-flop within the given clock period.

These checks ensure that\\nthe proper data is ready and available for capture and latched in for the\\nnew state.\\nThe more important aspect of static timing analysis is that the entire design\\nis analyzed once and the required timing checks are performed for all pos-', 'sible paths and scenarios of the design. Thus, STA is a complete and ex-\\nhaustive method for verifying the timing of a design.\\nFigure 1-1 Static timing analysis.\\nDesign\\nunder\\nanalysis\\n(DUA)\\nStatic Timing Analysis\\n(STA)\\nExternal environment\\nof design\\n(including clock definitions)\\nTiming reports\\n(include violating\\npaths, if any)', 'CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\n4\\nThe design under analysis is typically specified using a hardware descrip-\\ntion language such as VHDL1 or Verilog HDL2.

The\\ntiming reports are in ASCII form, typically with multiple columns, with', 'each column showing one attribute of the path delay. Many examples of\\ntiming reports are provided as illustrations in this book.\\n1.3 Why Static Timing Analysis?\\nStatic timing analysis is a complete and exhaustive verification of all timing\\nchecks of a design. Other timing analysis methods such as simulation can\\nonly verify the portions of the design that get exercised by stimulus. Verifi-', 'cation through timing simulation is only as exhaustive as the test vectors\\nused. To simulate and verify all timing conditions of a design with 10-100\\nmillion gates is very slow and the timing cannot be verified completely.\\nThus, it is very difficult to do exhaustive verification through simulation.\\nStatic timing analysis on the other hand provides a faster and simpler way', 'of checking and analyzing all the timing paths in a design for any timing\\nviolations. Given the complexity of present day ASICs 4, which may con-\\ntain 10 to 100 million gates, the static timing analysis has become a necessi-\\nty to exhaustively verify the timing of a design.\\nCrosstalk and Noise\\nThe design functionality and its performance can be limited by noise. The', 'noise occurs due to crosstalk with other signals or due to noise on primary\\ninputs or the power supply. The noise impact can limit the frequency of\\n1. See [BHA99] in Bibliography.\\n2.

Thus, a de-\\nsign implementation must be verified to be robust which means that it can\\nwithstand the noise without affecting the rated performance of the design.\\nVerification based upon logic simulation cannot handle the effects of cross-\\ntalk, noise and on-chip variations.', 'talk, noise and on-chip variations.\\nThe analysis methods described in this book cover not only the traditional\\ntiming analysis techniques but also noise analysis to verify the design in-\\ncluding the effects of noise.\\n1.4 Design Flow\\nThis section primarily describes the CMOS1 digital design flow in the con-\\ntext used in the rest of this book.

The parasitic RC ( Resistance and Capacitance) of the metal\\ntraces impact the signal path delay through these traces. In a typical nano-', 'meter design, the parasitics of the interconnect can account for the majority\\nof the delay and power dissipation in the design. Thus, any analysis of the\\ndesign should evaluate the impact of the interconnect on the performance\\ncharacteristics (speed, power, etc.). As mentioned previously, coupling be-\\ntween signal traces contributes to noise, and the design verification must', 'include the impact of the noise on the performance.\\nAt the logical design phase, ideal interconnect may be assumed since there\\nis no physical information related to the placement; there may be more in-\\nterest in viewing the logic that contributes to the worst paths. Another\\ntechnique used at this stage is to estimate the length of the interconnect us-', 'ing a wireload model. The wireload model provides estimated RC based\\non the fanouts of a cell.\\nBefore the routing of traces are finalized, the implementation tools use an\\nestimate of the routing distance to obtain RC parasitics for the route. Since\\nthe routing is not finalized, this phase is called the global route phase to dis-', 'tinguish it from the final route phase. In the global route phase of the physi-\\ncal design, simplified routes are used to estimate routing lengths, and the\\nrouting estimates are used to determine resistance and capacitance that are\\nneeded to compute wire delays. During this phase, one can not include the\\neffect of coupling. After the detailed routing is complete, actual RC values', 'obtained from extraction are used and the effect of coupling can be ana-\\nlyzed. However, a physical design tool may still use approximations to\\nhelp improve run times in computing RC values.\\nAn extraction tool is used to extract the detailed parasitics (RC values)\\nfrom a routed design. Such an extractor may have an option to obtain para-', 'sitics with small runtime and less accurate RC values during iterative opti-\\nmization and another option for final verification during which very\\naccurate RC values are extracted with a larger runtime.', 'CHAPTER 1 Introduction\\n8\\nTo summarize, the static timing analysis can be performed on a gate-level\\nnetlist depending on:\\ni.

In reality, each of these steps perform', 'integrated (and incremental) STA within their functionality. For example,\\nthe timing analysis engine within the logic optimization step is used to\\nidentify critical paths that the optimizer needs to work on. Similarly, the in-\\ntegrated timing analysis engine in a placement tool is used to maintain the\\ntiming of the design as layout progresses incrementally.\\n1.4.2 FPGA Designs', '1.4.2 FPGA Designs\\nThe basic flow of STA is still valid in an FPGA.

Reset sequence : To check if all flip-flops are reset into their re-\\nquired logical values after an asynchronous or synchronous re-\\nset. This is something that cannot be checked using static\\ntiming analysis. The chip may not come out of reset. This is be-\\ncause certain declarations such as initial values on signals are', 'not synthesized and are only verified during simulation.\\nii. X-handling : The STA techniques only deal with the logical do-\\nmain of logic-0 and logic-1 (or high and low), rise and fall. An\\nunknown value X in the design causes indeterminate values to\\npropagate through the design, which cannot be checked with\\nSTA. Even though the noise analysis within STA can analyze', 'and propagate the glitches through the design, the scope of\\nglitch analysis and propagation is very different than the X\\nhandling as part of the simulation based timing verification for\\nnanometer designs.\\niii.

False paths : The static timing analysis verifies that timing\\nthrough the logic path meets all the constraints, and flags vio-', 'lations if the timing through a logic path does not meet the re-\\nquired specifications. In many cases, the STA may flag a logic\\npath as a failing path, even though logic may never be able to\\npropagate through the path.

In a CMOS logic gate, the output node is connected by a pull-up\\nstructure (made up of PMOS transistors) to Vdd and a pull-down structure\\n(made up of NMOS transistors) to Vss. As an example, a two-input CMOS', 'nand gate is shown in Figure 2-3. In this example, the pull-up structure is\\ncomprised of the two parallel PMOS transistors and the pull-down struc-\\nture is made up of two series NMOS transistors.\\nFor any CMOS logic gate, the pull-up and pull-down structures are com-\\nplementary. For inputs at logic-0 or logic-1, this means that if the pull-up', 'stage is turned on, the pull-down stage will be off and similarly if the pull-\\nup stage is turned off, the pull-down stage will be turned on. The pull-\\ndown and pull-up structures are governed by the logic function imple-\\nmented by the CMOS gate. For example, in a CMOSnand gate, the function\\ncontrolling the pull-down structure is “A and B”, that is, the pull-down is', 'turned on when A and B are both at logic-1. Similarly, the function control-\\nling the pull-up structure is “not A or not B”, that is, the pull-up is turnedon\\nwhen either A or B is at logic-0. These characteristics ensure that the output\\nnode logic will be pulled to Vdd based upon the function controlling the\\npull-up structure. Since the pull-down structure is controlled by a comple-', '1. Depending upon the specifics of the CMOS technology, there is a small amount of leak-\\nage current that is drawn even in steady state.\\nFigure 2-2 A CMOS inverter.\\nA\\nVdd\\nVss\\nZ\\nNMOS transistor\\nPMOS transistor', 'CHAPTER 2 STA Concepts\\n18\\nmentary function, the output node is at logic-0 when the pull-up structure\\nfunction evaluates to 0.\\nFor inputs at logic-0 or at logic-1, the CMOS logic gate does not draw any\\ncurrent from the inputs or from the power supply in steady state since the\\npull-up and pull-down structures can not both be on1. Another important', 'aspect of CMOS logic is that the inputs pose only a capacitive load to the\\nprevious stage.\\nThe CMOS logic gate is an inverting gate which means that a single switch-\\ning input (rising or falling) can only cause the output to switch in the oppo-\\nsite direction, that is, the output can not switch in the same direction as the\\nswitching input. The CMOS logic gates can however be cascaded to put to-', 'gether a more complex logic function - inverting as well as non-inverting.\\n2.1.3 Standard Cells\\nMost of the complex functionality in a chip is normally designed using ba-\\nsic building blocks which implement simple logic functions such as and, or,\\nnand, nor, a nd-or-invert, or-and-invert and flip-flop.

In general, these arcs can also\\nbe state-dependent.\\nFor the example shown in Figure 3-11, the timing arcs can be placed under\\nthe following categories:\\n• Input to output combinational arc : This corresponds to a direct\\ncombinational path from input to output, such as from the input\\nport FIN to the output port FOUT.', 'CHAPTER 3 Standard Cell Library\\n74\\n• Input sequential arc: This is described as setup or hold time for the\\ninput connected to a D-pin of the flip-flop. In general, there can\\nbe combinational logic from the input of the block before it is\\nconnected to a D-pin of the flip-flop. An example of this is a set-\\nup check at port DIN with respect to clock ACLK.', 'up check at port DIN with respect to clock ACLK.\\n• Asynchronous input arc: This is similar to the recovery or removal\\ntiming constraint for the input asynchronous pins of a flip-flop.\\nAn example is the input ARST to the asynchronous clear pin of\\nflip-flop UFF0.\\n• Output sequential arc : This is similar to the output propagation\\ntiming for the clock to output connected to Q of the flip-flop.

In real-\\nity, the load seen by the cell output is comprised of capacitance as well as\\ninterconnect resistance. The interconnect resistance becomes an issue since\\nthe NLDM approach assumes that the output loading is purely capacitive.\\nEven with non-zero interconnect resistance, these NLDM models have', 'been utilized when the effect of interconnect resistance is small. In pres-\\nence of resistive interconnect, the delay calculation methodologies retrofit\\nthe NLDM models by obtaining an equivalent effective capacitance at the\\noutput of the cell. The “effective” capacitance methodology used within\\ndelay calculation tools obtains an equivalent capacitance that has the same', 'delay at the output of the cell as the cell with RC interconnect. The effective\\ncapacitance approach is described as part of delay calculation in Section\\n5.2.\\nAs the feature size shrinks, the effect of interconnect resistance can result in\\nlarge inaccuracy as the waveforms become highly non-linear. Various\\nmodeling approaches provide additional accuracy for the cell output driv-', 'ers. Broadly, these approaches obtain higher accuracy by modeling the out-', 'CHAPTER 3 Standard Cell Library\\n76\\nput stage of the driver by an equivalent current source. Examples of these\\napproaches are - CCS (Composite Current Source), or ECSM ( Effective\\nCurrent Source Model). For example, the CCS timing models provide the\\nadditional accuracy for modeling cell output drivers by using a time-vary-\\ning and voltage-dependent current source.

Unlike the pin capacitance for the NLDM', 'models, the CCS models allow separate specification of receiver capaci-\\ntance in different portions of the transitioning waveform. Due to intercon-\\nnect RC and the equivalent input non-linear capacitance due to the Miller\\neffect from the input devices within the cell, the receiver capacitance value\\nvaries at different points on the transitioning waveform. This capacitance', 'is thus modeled differently in the initial (or leading) portion of waveform\\nversus the trailing portion of the waveform.\\nThe receiver pin capacitance can be specified at the pin level (like in NLDM\\nmodels) where all timing arcs through that pin use that capacitance value.\\nAlternately, the receiver capacitance can be specified at the timing arc level', 'in which case different capacitance models can be specified for different\\ntiming arcs.

The internal\\npower in the library thus actually specifies the internal energy dissipated\\nper transition.\\nIn addition to the power tables, the example above also illustrates the spec-\\nification of the power pins, ground pins, and the power down function', 'which specifies the condition when the cell can be powered off. These con-\\nstructs allow for multiple power supplies in the design and scenarios\\nwhere different supplies may be powered down.

Just like the timing arcs, the pow-\\ner specification can also be state-dependent. For example, the state-', 'dependent power dissipation for an xor cell can be specified as dependent\\non the state of various inputs.\\nFor combinational cells, the switching power is specified on an input-\\noutput pin pair basis. However for a sequential cell such as a flip-flop with\\ncomplementary outputs, Q and QN, the CLK->Q transition also results in a', 'CLK->QN transition. Thus, the library can specify the internal switching\\npower as a three-dimensional table, which is shown next. The three dimen-\\nsions in the example below are the input slew atCLK and the output capac-\\nitances at Q and QN respectively.\\npin (Q) {\\n. . .\\ninternal_power() {\\nrelated_pin : \"CLK\";\\nequal_or_opposite_output : \"QN\";\\nrise_power(energy_template_3x2x2) {', 'rise_power(energy_template_3x2x2) {\\nindex_1 (\"0.02, 0.2, 1.0\"); /* Clock transition */\\nindex_2 (\"0.005, 0.2\"); /* Output Q capacitance */\\nindex_3 (\"0.005, 0.2\"); /* Output QN capacitance */\\nvalues ( /* 0.005 0.2 */ /* 0.005 0.2 */ \\\\\\n/* 0.02 */ \"0.060, 0.070\", \"0.061, 0.068\", \\\\\\n/* 0.2 */ \"0.061, 0.071\", \"0.063, 0.069\", \\\\\\n/* 1.0 */ \"0.062, 0.080\", \"0.068, 0.075\");\\n}', '/* 1.0 */ \"0.062, 0.080\", \"0.068, 0.075\");\\n}\\nfall_power(energy_template_3x2x2) {\\nindex_1 (\"0.02, 0.2, 1.0\");', 'Power Dissipation Modeling S ECTION 3.8\\n91\\nindex_2 (\"0.005, 0.2\");\\nindex_3 (\"0.005, 0.2\");\\nvalues ( \\\\\\n\"0.070, 0.080\", \"0.071, 0.078\", \\\\\\n\"0.071, 0.081\", \"0.073, 0.079\", \\\\\\n\"0.066, 0.082\", \"0.068, 0.085\");\\n}\\n}\\nSwitching power can be dissipated even when the outputs or the internal\\nstate does not have a transition. A common example is the clock that tog-', 'gles at the clock pin of a flip-flop. The flip-flop dissipates power with each\\nclock toggle - typically due to switching of an inverter inside of the flip-\\nflop cell. The power due to clock pin toggle is dissipated even if the flip-\\nflop output does not switch. Thus for sequential cells, the input pin power\\nrefers to the power dissipation internal to the cell, that is, when the outputs', 'do not transition.

It is thus important that the values in the CLK->Q power specifi-', 'cation tables do not include the contribution due to the CLK internal power\\ncorresponding to the condition when the output Q does not switch.\\nThe above guideline refers to consistency of usage of power tables by the\\napplication tool and ensures that the internal power specified due to clock\\ninput is not double-counted during power calculation.\\n3.8.2 Leakage Power', '3.8.2 Leakage Power\\nMost standard cells are designed such that the power is dissipated only\\nwhen the output or state changes. Any power dissipated when the cell is\\npowered but there is no activity is due to non-zero leakage current. The\\nleakage can be due to subthreshold current for MOS devices or due to tun-\\nneling current through the gate oxide. In the earlier generations of CMOS', 'process technologies, the leakage power has been negligible and has not\\nbeen a major consideration during the design process. However, as the\\ntechnology shrinks, the leakage power is becoming significant and is no\\nlonger negligible in comparison to active power.\\nAs described above, the leakage power contribution is from two phenome-', 'na: subthreshold current in the MOS device and gate oxide tunneling. By\\nusing high Vt cells 1, one can reduce the subthreshold current; however,\\n1. The high Vt cells refer to cells with higher threshold voltage than the standard for the\\nprocess technology.', 'Power Dissipation Modeling S ECTION 3.8\\n93\\nthere is a trade-off due to reduced speed of the high Vt cells. The high Vt\\ncells have smaller leakage but are slower in speed. Similarly, the low Vt\\ncells have larger leakage but allow greater speed. The contribution due to\\ngate oxide tunneling does not change significantly by switching to high (or', 'low) Vt cells. Thus, a possible way to control the leakage power is to utilize\\nhigh Vt cells. Similar to the selection between high Vt and standard Vt\\ncells, the strength of cells used in the design is a trade-off between leakage\\nand speed. The higher strength cells have higher leakage power but pro-\\nvide higher speed. The trade-off related to power management are de-', 'scribed in detail in Section 10.6.\\nThe subthreshold MOS leakage has a strong non-linear dependence with\\nrespect to temperature. In most process technologies, the subthreshold\\nleakage can grow by 10x to 20x as the device junction temperature is in-\\ncreased from 25C to 125C. The contribution due to gate oxide tunneling is\\nrelatively invariant with respect to temperature or the Vt of the devices.', 'The gate oxide tunneling which was negligible at process technologies\\n100nm and above, has become a significant contributor to leakage at lower\\ntemperatures for 65nm or finer technologies. For example, gate oxide tun-\\nneling leakage may equal the subthreshold leakage at room temperature\\nfor 65nm or finer process technologies. At high temperatures, the sub-', 'threshold leakage continues to be the dominant contributor to leakage\\npower.\\nLeakage power is specified for each cell in the library. For example, an in-\\nverter cell may contain the following specification:\\ncell_leakage_power : 1.366;\\nThis is the leakage power dissipated in the cell - the leakage power units\\nare as specified in the header of the library, typically in nanowatts. In gen-', 'eral, the leakage power depends upon the state of the cell and state depen-\\ndent values can be specified using the when condition.', 'CHAPTER 3 Standard Cell Library\\n94\\nFor example, an INV1 cell can have the following specification:\\ncell_leakage_power : 0.70;\\nleakage_power() {\\nwhen : \"!I\";\\nvalue : 1.17;\\n}\\nleakage_power() {\\nwhen : \"I\";\\nvalue : 0.23;\\n}\\nwhere I is the input pin of the INV1 cell. It should be noted that the specifi-\\ncation includes a default value (outside of thewhen conditions) and that the', 'default value is generally the average of the leakage values specified with-\\nin the when conditions.\\n3.9 Other Attributes in Cell Library\\nIn addition to the timing information, a cell description in the library spec-\\nifies area, functionality and the SDF condition of the timing arcs.

Similarly, the output of the inverter cell may', 'be low (that is, stay below VOL maximum value) as long as the input stays\\nabove the VIH minimum value.

Models for DC\\nmargin can be specified as part of the cell library description. A glitch be-\\nlow the DC margin limit (for example, a rise glitch below theVILmax of the\\nfanout pins) cannot be propagated through the fanout irrespective of the', 'width of the glitch. Thus, a conservative glitch analysis checks that the\\npeak voltage level (for all glitches) meets the VIL and the VIH levels of the\\nfanout cells. As long as all nets meet the VIL and VIH levels for the fanout\\ncells in spite of any glitches, it can be concluded that the glitches have no\\nimpact on the functionality of the design (since the glitches cannot cause', 'the output to change).\\nFigure 6-4 DC transfer characteristics of an inverter cell.\\nVout\\nVin\\nUnity slope points\\nVILmax VIHmin\\nVOHmin\\nVOLmax\\nUnity gain\\npoint', 'Crosstalk Glitch Analysis S ECTION 6.2\\n155\\nFigure 6-5 shows an example of DC margin limits.

Just like the SRAM interface,\\nthere are two main buses. Figure 9-9 illustrates the bus connectivity and\\nthe bus directions between the DUA and the SDRAM. The first bus, which', 'consists of command, address, and control pins (often called CAC) uses the\\nstandard scheme of sending information out on one clock edge of a memo-\\nry clock (or once per clock cycle). The two bidirectional buses consist of the\\nDQ, the data bus, and DQS, the data strobe. The main differentiation of the\\nDDR interface is the bidirectional data strobe DQS. A DQS strobe is pro-', 'vided for a group of data signals. This allows the data signals (one per byte\\nor one per half-byte) to have tightly matched timing with the strobe; such a\\ntight match may not be feasible with the clock signal if the clock is common\\nfor the entire data bus. The bidirectional strobe signal DQS is used for both\\nthe read and the write operations. The strobe is used to capture the data on', 'both its edges (both falling and rising edges or Double Data Rate). The DQ\\nbus is source synchronous to the data strobe DQS (instead of a memory\\nclock) during the read mode of SDRAM, that is, the DQ and DQS are\\naligned with each other when they are sent out from the SDRAM. In the\\nother direction, that is when the DUA is sending the data, theDQS is phase', 'shifted by 90 degrees. Note that both the data DQ and the strobe DQS edg-\\nes are derived from the memory clock inside the DUA.\\nFigure 9-9 DDR SDRAM interface.\\nSDRAM memory\\ncontroller\\nSDRAMCAC bus\\nDDRCLK\\nData bus (DQ)\\nData strobe (DQS)\\nDUA\\nCAC\\nCK\\nDQ\\nDQS', 'CHAPTER 9 Interface Analysis\\n342\\nAs described above, there is one data strobe DQS for a group of DQ signals\\n(four or eight bits). This is done to make the skew balancing requirements\\nbetween all bits of DQ and DQS easier.

As discussed above, modeling of OCV is not in-\\ntended to model the entire span of the PVT variations possible from wafer\\nto wafer but to model the PVT variations that are possible locally within a\\nsingle die. The OCV effect is typically more pronounced on clock paths as\\nthey travel longer distances in a chip. One way to account for the local PVT', 'variations is to incorporate the OCV analysis during STA. The static timing\\nanalysis described in previous chapters obtains the timing at a specific tim-\\ning corner and does not model the variations along the die. Since the clock\\nand data paths can be affected differently by the OCV, the timing verifica-\\ntion can model the OCV effect by making the PVT conditions for the', 'launch and capture paths to be slightly different. The STA can include the\\nOCV effect by derating the delays of specific paths, that is, by making those\\npaths faster or slower and then validating the behavior of the design with\\nthese variations.

In a latch, one edge of the clock makes the latch transparent, that\\nis, it opens the latch so that output of the latch is the same as the data input;', 'this clock edge is called the opening edge. The second edge of the clock\\ncloses the latch, that is, any change on the data input is no longer available\\nat the output of the latch; this clock edge is called the closing edge.\\nTypically, the data should be ready at a latch input before the active edge\\nof the clock. However, since a latch is transparent when the clock is active,', 'the data can arrive later than the active clock edge, that is, it can borrow\\ntime from the next cycle. If such time is borrowed, the time available for\\nthe following stage (latch to another sequential cell) is reduced.\\nFigure 10-3 shows an example of time borrowing using an active rising\\nedge. If data DIN is ready at time A prior to the latch opening on the rising', 'edge of CLK at 10ns, the data flows to the output of the latch as it opens. If\\ndata arrives at time B as shown for DIN (delayed), it borrows time Tb. How-\\never, this reduces the time available from the latch to the next flip-flop\\nUFF2 - instead of a complete clock cycle, only time Ta is available.\\nThe first rule in timing to a latch is that if the data arrives before the open-', 'ing edge of the latch, the behavior is modeled exactly like a flip-flop. The\\nopening edge captures the data and the same clock edge launches the data\\nas the start point for the next path.', 'CHAPTER 10 Robust Verification\\n378\\nThe second rule applies when the data signal arrives while the latch is\\ntransparent (between the opening and the closing edge). The output of the\\nlatch, rather than the clock pin, is used as the launch point for the next\\nstage. The amount of time borrowed by the path ending at the latch deter-\\nmines the launch time for the next stage.', 'mines the launch time for the next stage.\\nA data signal that arrives after the closing edge at the latch is a timing vio-\\nlation.

The high Vt cells have less leakage, though these\\nare slower than the standard Vt cells which are faster but have higher leak-\\nage. Similarly, the low Vt cells are faster than standard Vt cells but the leak-', 'age is also correspondingly higher.\\nIn most designs, the goal is to minimize the total power while achieving\\nthe desired operational speed. Even though leakage can be a significant\\ncomponent of the total power, implementing a design with only high Vt\\ncells to reduce leakage can increase the total power even though the leak-\\nage contribution may be reduced. This is because the resulting design im-', 'plementation may require many more (or higher strength) high Vt cells to\\nachieve the required performance. The increase in equivalent gate count\\ncan increase the active power much more than the reduction in leakage\\npower due to use of high Vt cells. However, there are scenarios where the\\nleakage is a dominant component of the total power; in such cases, a de-', 'sign with high Vt cells can result in reduction of the total power. The above\\ntrade-off between cells with different Vt in terms of their speed and leak-\\nage needs to be utilized suitably since it is dependent on the design and its\\nswitching activity profile. Two scenarios of a high performance block are\\nillustrated below where the implementation approach can be different de-', 'pending on whether the block is very active or has low switching activity.\\nHigh Performance Block with High Activity\\nThis scenario is of a high performance block with high switching activity\\nand the power is dominated by the active power. For such blocks, focus-\\nsing only on reducing leakage power can cause the total power to increase', 'even though the leakage contribution may be minimized. In such cases, the\\ninitial design implementation should use standard Vt (or low Vt) cells to\\nmeet the desired performance. After the required timing is achieved, the\\ncells along the paths which have positive timing slack can be changed into\\nhigh Vt cells so that the leakage contribution is reduced while still meeting', 'the timing requirement. Thus, in the final implementation, the standard Vt\\n(or low Vt) cells are used only along the critical or hard to achieve timing', 'Power Management S ECTION 10.6\\n417\\npaths, whereas cells along the non-critical timing paths can be high Vt\\ncells.\\nHigh Performance Block with Low Activity\\nThis scenario is of a high performance block with very low switching activ-\\nity so that the leakage power is a significant component of the total power.\\nSince the block has low activity, the active power is not a major component', 'for the total power of the design. For such blocks, the initial implementa-\\ntion attempts to use only high Vt cells in the combinational logic and flip-\\nflops. An exception is the clock tree which is always active and therefore is\\nbuilt with standard Vt (or low Vt) cells. After the initial implementation\\nwith only high Vt cells, there may be some timing paths where the re-', 'quired timing cannot be achieved. The cells along such paths are then re-\\nplaced with standard Vt (or low Vt) cells to achieve the required timing\\nperformance.\\n10.6.4 Well Bias\\nThe well bias refers to adding a small voltage bias to the P-well or N-well\\nused for the NMOS and PMOS devices respectively.

Similarly, the bulk (or N-well) connection for the PMOS\\ndevice shown in Figure 2-1 is normally connected to the power (Vdd) rail.\\nThe leakage power can be reduced significantly if the well connections\\nhave a slight negative bias. This means that the P-well for the NMOS devic-\\nes is connected to a small negative voltage (such as -0.5V). Similarly, the N-', 'well connection for the PMOS devices is connected to a voltage above the\\npower rail (such as Vdd + 0.5V). By adding a well bias, the speed of the cell\\nis impacted; however the leakage is reduced substantially. The timing in\\nthe cell libraries are generated by taking the well bias into account.\\nThe drawback of using well bias is that it requires additional supply levels', '(such as -0.5V and Vdd+0.5V) for the P-well and N-well connections.', 'CHAPTER 10 Robust Verification\\n418\\n10.7 Backannotation\\n10.7.1 SPEF\\nHow does STA know what the parasitics of the design are?

The statistical approach models all possible\\ncombinations of variations in the interconnect space and thus models vari-\\nations which may not be captured by analyzing only at the specified inter-\\nconnect corners. For example, it is possible that the launch path of a clock', 'tree is in METAL2, whereas the capture path of the clock tree is in\\nMETAL3.

Such a combination', 'corresponds to the worst-case scenario for the setup paths and can only be\\ncaptured by modeling the interconnect variations statistically.\\n10.9.2 Statistical Analysis\\nWhat is SSTA?\\nThe modeling of variations described above is feasible if the cell timing\\nmodels and the interconnect parasitics are modeled statistically. Apart', 'from delay, the pin capacitance values at the inputs of the cells are also\\nmodeled statistically. This implies that the timing models are described in\\nterms of mean and standard deviations with respect to process parameters\\n(global and local). The interconnect resistances and capacitances are de-\\nscribed in terms of mean and standard deviations with respect to intercon-', 'nect parameters. The delay calculation procedures (described in Chapter 5)\\nobtain the delays of each timing arc (cell as well as interconnect) which are\\nthen represented by mean and standard deviations with respect to various\\nparameters. Thus, every delay is represented by a mean and N standard\\ndeviations (where N is the number of independent process and intercon-', 'nect parameters modeled statistically).\\nSince the delays through individual timing arcs are expressed statistically,\\nthe statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) procedure combines the delays\\nof the timing arcs to obtain the path delay which is also expressed statisti-\\ncally (with mean and standard deviations). The SSTA maps the standard', 'deviations with respect to the independent process and interconnect pa-\\nrameters to obtain the overall standard deviation of the path delay. For ex-\\nample, consider the path delay comprised from two timing arcs as shown', 'CHAPTER 10 Robust Verification\\n428\\nin Figure 10-29. Since each delay component has its variations, the varia-\\ntions are combined differently depending upon whether these are correlat-\\ned or uncorrelated. If the variations are from the same source (such as\\ncaused by g_par1 which track each other), the s of the path delay is simply', 'equal to (s1 + s2). However, if the variations are uncorrelated (such as due\\nto l_par1), the s of the path delay is equal tosqrt(s12 + s22), which is smaller\\nthan (s1 + s2). The phenomenon of smaller s for the path delay when mod-\\neling local (uncorrelated) process variations is also referred to as statistical\\ncancellation of the individual delay variations.', 'cancellation of the individual delay variations.\\nFor a real design, both correlated as well as uncorrelated variations are\\nmodeled, and thus the contributions from both of these types of variations\\nneed to be combined appropriately.\\nThe clock path delays for launch and capture clock are also expressed sta-\\ntistically in the same manner.

It is an IEEE standard - IEEE Std\\n1497. It is an ASCII text file. It describes timing information and con-\\nstraints. Its purpose is to serve as a textual timing exchange medium be-\\ntween various tools. It can also be used to describe timing data for tools', 'that require it.

Additionally, it is the', 'responsibility of the SDF annotator to ensure that the timing values in the\\nSDF are interpreted correctly.', 'APPENDIX B Standard Delay Format (SDF)\\n496\\nThe SDF annotator annotates the backannotation timing generics and pa-\\nrameters.

If certain SDF constructs\\nare not supported by an SDF annotator, no errors are produced - the anno-\\ntator simply ignores these.', 'tator simply ignores these.\\nIf the SDF annotator fails to modify a backannotation timing generic, then\\nthe value of the generic is not modified during the backannotation process,\\nthat is, it is left unchanged.\\nIn a simulation tool, backannotation typically occurs just following the\\nelaboration phase and directly preceding negative constraint delay calcula-\\ntion.\\nB.3.1 Verilog HDL', 'tion.\\nB.3.1 Verilog HDL\\nIn Verilog HDL, the primary mechanism for annotation is the specify\\nblock.

Timing data can be specified only for a VITAL-compli-\\nant model using SDF. There are two ways to pass timing data into a VHDL\\nmodel: via configurations, or directly into simulation. The SDF annotation', 'process consists of mapping SDF constructs and corresponding generics in\\na VITAL-compliant model during simulation.\\nIn a VITAL-compliant model, there are rules on how generics are to be\\nnamed and declared that ensures that a mapping can be established be-\\ntween the timing generics of a model and the corresponding SDF timing\\ninformation.', 'information.\\nA timing generic is made up of a generic name and its type. The name\\nspecifies the kind of timing information and the type of the generic speci-\\nfies the kind of timing value. If the name of generic does not follow the VI-\\nTAL standard, then it is not a timing generic and does not get annotated.', 'APPENDIX B Standard Delay Format (SDF)\\n500\\nHere is the table showing how SDF delay values are mapped to VHDL de-\\nlays.\\nIn VHDL, timing information is backannotated via generics. Generic\\nnames follow a certain convention so as to be consistent or derived from\\nSDF constructs.

It is an IEEE standard - IEEE Std\\n1497. It is an ASCII text file. It describes timing information and con-\\nstraints. Its purpose is to serve as a textual timing exchange medium be-\\ntween various tools. It can also be used to describe timing data for tools', 'that require it. Since it is an IEEE standard, timing information generated\\nby one tool can be consumed by a number of other tools that support such\\na standard. The data is represented in a tool-independent and language-\\nindependent way and it includes specification of interconnect delays, de-\\nvice delays and timing checks.', 'vice delays and timing checks.\\nSince SDF is an ASCII file, it is human-readable, though these files tend to\\nbe rather large for real designs. However, it is meant as an exchange medi-\\num between tools. Quite often when exchanging information, one could\\npotentially run into a problem where a tool generates an SDF file but the', 'other tool that reads SDF does not read the SDF properly. The tool reader\\ncould either generate an error or a warning reading the SDF or it might in-\\nterpret the values in the SDF incorrectly. In that case, one may have to look\\ninto the file and see what went wrong. This chapter explains the basics of\\nthe SDF file and provides necessary and sufficient information to help un-', 'derstand and debug any annotation problems.\\nFigure B-1 shows a typical flow of how an SDF file is used. A timing calcu-\\nlator tool typically generates the timing information that is stored in an\\nSDF file. This information is then backannotated into the design by the tool\\nthat reads the SDF. Note that the complete design information is not cap-', 'tured in an SDF file, but only the delay values are stored. For example, in-\\nstance names and pin names of instances are captured in the SDF as they\\nare necessary to specify instance-specific or pin-specific delays.

            "2. Reliability: The reliability of a design is another important factor. The reliability of a design can be improved by using design techniques that reduce the likelihood of errors and by using redundancy to increase the reliability of the design.\n",
            "3. Timing: The timing of a design is also an important consideration. The timing of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum clock period and the setup and hold times for the inputs and outputs of the design.\n",
            "4. Area: The area of a design is a measure of the amount of silicon that is required to implement the design. The area of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum area that is allowed for the design.\n",
            "5. Testability: The testability of a design is a measure of the ease with which the design can be tested. The testability of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum number of test vectors that are required to test the design and by specifying the maximum amount of time that is allowed for testing the design.\n",
            "6. Security: The security of a design is a measure of the resistance of the design to malicious attacks. The security of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum level of security that is required for the design.\n",
            "7. Performance: The performance of a design is a measure of the speed at which the design can operate. The performance of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum clock frequency and the maximum latency that is allowed for the design.\n",
            "8. Cost: The cost of a design is a measure of the resources that are required to implement the design. The cost of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum budget that is allowed for the design.\n",
            "9. Manufacturability: The manufacturability of a design is a measure of the ease with which the design can be manufactured. The manufacturability of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum number of layers that are allowed for the design and by specifying the maximum aspect ratio that is allowed for the design.\n",
            "10. Compatibility: The compatibility of a design is a measure of the ability of the design to interoperate with other designs. The compatibility of a design can be constrained by specifying the maximum number of interfaces that are allowed for the design and by specifying the maximum number of protocols that are allowed for the design.\n"
